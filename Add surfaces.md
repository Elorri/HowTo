# Determines surfaces following those rules

	affordance : intuition about what something can do.
	any ui element lives on a surfaces
	if an element is closer to us (=on a higher surface, like a FAB) it must be more important
	if content is homogenus better use a single surface (prefer a listview over a list of cardview) it will be easier to scan.
	if content is hererogenus better use individual surfaces, but try not to have more than 5 surfaces at once
	items related should be on the same surface.
	
	Material cannot pass through other material. like here : https://material.google.com/what-is-material/material-properties.html#material-properties-physical-properties
	
	Github sample : DynamicSurfacesDemo

	collapsing toolbar with image. try and see if the text below image is a litle bit scroll for make the user guess there is hidden data.
