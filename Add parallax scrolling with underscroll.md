## Parallax srolling =  Scrolling in parallel
		= when we have several level of views scrolling at different speed, it's one way to create an illusion of depth in material design and it's possible with RecyclerView for devices abouve HoneyComb, the app will continue to run on Gingerbread without parallax srolling.
		Cad l'ensemble de la detailActivity au lieu de rester figée, va scroller à la 1/2 de lavitesse de scroll de la listview (enfin recycler view).
