 how to identify the most important positions in your company - and how to get your most talented employees into those positions.
 
 Why would people come to you ? because they feel you can make them move forward
 You create community by defering your choice to people you trust.
 


 
 
 # Planning
 - does involve human ressources.
 
 - What needs to be achieved ?
 - When should it be achieved ?
 - What are the possible scenarios ?
 - For what are strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
 example : 
 strenght : motivated workforce
 weaknesses : unmotivated workforce
 oppportunity : niche
 threats : concurrence
 - Make a plan for each of them.
 - Which one you choose, is there gateway in case we want to change ?
 
 # Organizing
 - involve human ressources.
 - Successful managers make sure that all the activities identified in the planning process are assigned to some person, department, or team and that everyone has the resources needed to perform assigned activities.
 
 - For every task of the plan, name the possible people that can do it, and how many hours it will take, and where
 - Go and ask them (at best it should be exactly what they want in their life at this moment)
 
 # Leading
  Leadership : motivate, mobilizing others to want to struggle toward a common goal.  if you give the proper tools to a group of people who like to make a difference, they will. A manager takes people where they want to go.
  transformational leaders mentor and develop subordinates, providing them with challenging opportunities, working one-on-one to help them meet their professional and personal needs, and encouraging people to approach problems from new perspectives. They stimulate employees to look beyond personal interests to those of the group.
  In today’s organizations, in which team building and information sharing are important and projects are often collaborative in nature, transformational leadership has proven to be more effective than traditional leadership.
  
  The Push Method – this approach is logical and aggressive with quick
results. When using this method, managers may make demands on
employees without considering the immediate or long-term impacts on
specific individuals. This aggressive approach may not be well-received.
As a result, employees may not be receptive or cooperative. However,
when used correctly, push strategies can bring about solid results.

The Pull Method – this approach is all about including the individual in the
decision-making process so that the person has a stake in the eventual
outcomes. This method usually leads to a proactive response, in which the
individual is more likely to fully accomplish the tasks set forth. Results
from this approach are generally positive, but may take a bit longer to
come to fruition in comparison to those achieved by means of the Push
Method approach.


Tell—this is much like the Tough Battler personality type we looked at in
our first model. Here, the leader uses his or her power and authority to
communicate what is to be done. The result is generally negative,
because the manager is seen as overbearing and dictatorial.
2. Sell—this style is much like the style of “relationship selling” a salesperson
might use. In this approach, the seller would find out what the needs and
desires are of his “customer” and attempt to meet those needs. Results
are generally positive as this tends to be a win-win approach.
3. Negotiate—as stated in the model above, negotiating is all about making
deals, trades, and bargains to accomplish your goals.
4. Problem Solve—this is much like the “bridging” style in the previous
model. A leader will create a common problem that can be solved by all
parties working together toward a solution.
5. Coach/Facilitate—this style enables individuals to provide their own
solutions as issues and new projects arise. They come to “own” the
problem and will generally work diligently to find a solution.

  
 # Controlling
 Every worker should do it every day
 
 ## Establishing performance standards
 ## Comparing actual performance against standards
 ## Taking corrective action when necessary.

 Self esteem survey : http://saylordotorg.github.io/text_principles-of-management-v1.1/s06-personality-attitudes-and-work.html
 
 Self-esteem is the degree to which a person has overall positive feelings about himself or herself. People with high self-esteem view themselves in a positive light, are confident, and respect themselves. In contrast, people with low self-esteem experience high levels of self-doubt and question their self-worth. High self-esteem is related to higher levels of satisfaction with one’s job and higher levels of performance on the job.
 Managing employees with low self-esteem may be challenging at times because negative feedback given with the intention of improving performance may be viewed as a negative judgment on their worth as an employee. Therefore, effectively managing employees with relatively low self-esteem requires tact and providing lots of positive feedback when discussing performance incidents.
 
 
 
  The ability to use a variety of skills, having autonomy at work, receiving feedback on the job, and performing a significant task are some job characteristics that are related to satisfaction and commitment. However, the presence of these factors is not important for everyone. Some people have a high need for growth. These employees tend to be more satisfied when their jobs help them build new skills and improve.
  
  
  A strong influence over our satisfaction level is how fairly we are treated. People pay attention to the fairness of company policies and procedures, fair and kind treatment from supervisors, and fairness of their pay and other rewards they receive from the company.
  
  The psychological contract is the unspoken, informal understanding that an employee will contribute certain things to the organization (e.g., work ability and a willing attitude) and will receive certain things in return (e.g., reasonable pay and benefits). Under the psychological contract, an employee may believe that if he or she works hard and receives favorable performance evaluations, he or she will receive an annual bonus, periodic raises and promotions, and will not be laid off. Since the “downsizing” trend of the past 20 years, many commentators have declared that the psychological contract is violated more often than not.
