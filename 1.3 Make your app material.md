# [Material Design](https://material.google.com/)

* [Calculate device resolution in dp](https://github.com/Elorri/HowTo/blob/master/Calculate%20device%20resolution%20in%20dp.md)
* [Choose and draw your components redlines]
* Add Material Design support libraries(corresponding to the component chosen)
# Add surfaces	
# Add light and shadows
# Theme and color your app
see "Color in material design is inspired by bold hues juxtaposed with muted environments, deep shadows, and bright highlights." https://material.google.com/style/color.html#
	primary : muted environments
	darkPrimary : deep shadows
	accent : bright highlights
# Style your app	
# Make readable res files

### Add user interaction reaction - Make app responsive
	Material is full of energy. It quickly responds to user input precisely where the user triggers it.
#### Create a piece of material
#### Add rising effect
#### Add ripple effect - Add radial reaction
#### Add a StateListAnimator
### Add guess hidden piece of material animation
#### Add scroll effect (??? look for appropriate file)
## Add natural asymetric ease curves
see  section "Natural Material depicts natural movement inspired by forces in the real world. In the real world, an object's ability to speed up or slow down quickly is affected by weight and surface friction. In a similar way, starts and stops do not occur instantaneously in material design.": https://material.google.com/motion/material-motion.html#material-motion-how-does-material-move
see section "A transition helps guide the user to the next step of an interaction." https://material.google.com/motion/material-motion.html#material-motion-how-does-material-move
see section "Natural easing curves" https://material.google.com/motion/duration-easing.html#duration-easing-natural-easing-curves
### Add a fast out slow in transition 
	
	for all on screen mouvement object
	for object that enter or exit the screen and move other objects
	for object that expand/collapse surface size (ex: if the user ask for more/less info. It also communicate hierarchy) 
		with asymetrical transformation (for rectangular surfaces that morph into other shapes)
		with symetrical transformation (for rectangular surfaces that morph into other shapes)
		with radial transformation (for circular surfaces that morph into other shapes)
		with shared element transition
			Add a shared element transition (since-21 lollipop)
			see section "A transition helps guide the user to the next step of an interaction." https://material.google.com/motion/material-motion.html#material-motion-how-does-material-move
			see section "Do. During the transition, the user is guided to the next view. The surface transforms to communicate hierarchy. Loading occurs behind the scenes to reduce perceived latency." https://material.google.com/motion/material-motion.html#material-motion-implications-of-motion	
			see section "All content elements are shared" https://material.google.com/motion/choreography.html
	for objects that divide/join themseleves (ex: good when this user is doing a copy/paste)
	
### Add a linear out slow in transition with scale in size or opacity (for objects that enter the screen)
### Add a fast out linear in transition with scale in size or opacity(for objects that leave the screen)
### Create new objects

	for object that create themselsves from the point of input or new surfaces from the center
		see "This menu appears from the touch point, tying the element to the point of touch." https://material.google.com/motion/choreography.html#choreography-creation
		see "An automatically triggered surface appears smoothly and quickly." https://material.google.com/motion/choreography.html#choreography-creation
		
	for multiple object that create themselsves from the point of input or new surfaces from the center	
	
		When multiple new surfaces are created at the same time, quickly stagger the appearance of each. Create a clear, smooth focal path in a single direction. Itemshould appears one by one but don't wait too long shouldn't be more than 20ms. Items shouldn’t appear within the list all at once. It’s overwhelming and eliminates a clear focus. 
		see "List items have a slightly staggered entrance. Grid items populate left to right, and top to bottom." https://material.google.com/motion/choreography.html#choreography-creation
		see "Images in this grid fade out based on the radial reaction around the tap point." https://material.google.com/motion/choreography.html#choreography-radial-reaction
		
	
# Add elevations (pre-21 lollipop)
# Add elevations (since-21 lollipop)
# Adapt your design to devices



# Add motion
## Hint user distinguish elements
## Keep user focus on a view
### Add a material push transition
## Make user focus on a view
### Add a shaking animation
## Hint user at what will happen if he completes a gesture
### Communicate action is not available
see section "Movement can communicate different signals, such as whether an action is unavailable." https://material.google.com/motion/material-motion.html#material-motion-how-does-material-move
## Distract user from what's usually boring (like fetching content or loading the next view)
	
	In practice dont display resfresh indicator.
	see : "Do. During the transition, the user is guided to the next view. The surface transforms to communicate hierarchy. Loading occurs behind the scenes to reduce perceived latency." https://material.google.com/motion/material-motion.html#material-motion-implications-of-motion
	
	When any element doesn't completely load by the time a transition completes, allow sufficient space in the location where the element will appear. This prevents jarring layout shifts when the elements finally appear, and avoids user frustration when a touch target suddenly jumps away.
	see "Make room for the unloaded elements during the transition and gracefully display them in place once they fully load." https://material.google.com/motion/choreography.html#choreography-continuity
	
## Add animated action icons

 when two actions are connected,  one cannot exist while the other is present. ex "Transforming the menu icon into the back arrow signifies that the two actions are connected, and that one cannot exist while the other is present. The back button must be pressed in order to return to the top-level view with the menu icon." https://material.google.com/motion/creative-customization.html#

## Add animated product icons

see "Animated product icons should demonstrate polish and refinement from the moment the app launches." https://material.google.com/motion/creative-customization.html#creative-customization-icons

## Add subtle illustration animation

see "Subtle animation in imagery and illustrations can add a sense of playfulness to the user experience." https://material.google.com/motion/creative-customization.html#creative-customization-icons
see bubble help educate user ex "Animating an illustration for a new feature can educate the user about the feature in a memorable way." https://material.google.com/motion/creative-customization.html#creative-customization-icons


speed, responsiveness, and intention


## Add matérial design for prélolipop devices
